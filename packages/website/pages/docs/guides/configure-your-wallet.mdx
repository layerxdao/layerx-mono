# Configure your wallet

## Overview

This guide help you connect your wallet to LayerX (Alpha-3 testnet). There are two networks to configure your wallet with: Ethereum (Sepolia testnet) and LayerX (Alpha-3 testnet).

## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed and ready to use. Some examples are MetaMask and Frame. Please use a hot wallet (not a hardware wallet) for this guide, preferably a throwaway wallet.

## Steps

<Steps>
    ### Visit chainlist
    Visit [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/) and check the box for "Include Testnets".

    ### Add the Sepolia testnet
    Search for "Sepolia", and click the "Add Chain" button. 
    
    You can also connect to Sepolia at [Sepolia RPC configuration](../reference/rpc-configuration#sepolia).

    ### Add the LayerX testnet
    Search for "LayerX", and click the "Add Chain" button for LayerX (Alpha-3 testnet).
        
    You can also connect to LayerX at [LayerX RPC configuration](../reference/rpc-configuration#taiko).

    ### Add tokens to your wallet
    Use your wallet (e.g., Metamask) to [import the tokens](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/6375103346077-Add-custom-tokens-to-MetaMask?docs=true) with these [contract addresses](/docs/reference/contract-addresses#erc-20-token-contracts) (HORSE, BLL, and TTKO).
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting
### The add chain buttons did not work
Try to manually add the network to your wallet using the [RPC configuration](/docs/reference/rpc-configuration).
